GitHub Actions let you **automate workflows** like testing or deploying.

Hereâ€™s a simple workflow file (`.github/workflows/hello.yml`):

```yaml
name: Say Hello
on: [push]
jobs:
  hello-world:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Print message
        run: echo "Hello from GitHub Actions!"
