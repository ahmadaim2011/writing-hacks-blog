Here are some **advanced Git commands** that go beyond the basics:

- `git stash` â†’ save changes without committing, useful when you want to switch branches quickly.  
- `git cherry-pick <commit>` â†’ copy one specific commit from another branch.  
- `git rebase -i HEAD~3` â†’ interactively edit the last 3 commits.  
- `git reflog` â†’ see all actions youâ€™ve done, even if you lost commits.  

ðŸ’¡ These are great for **cleaning up history** and **recovering lost work**.
